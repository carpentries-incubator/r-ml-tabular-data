## Decision Trees

TODO: describe the general idea of a decision tree.

```{r, message=FALSE, results=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
trainSize <- round(0.75 * nrow(kyphosis))
set.seed(6789) # so we all get the same random sets
trainIndex <- sample(nrow(kyphosis), trainSize)
trainDF <- kyphosis %>% slice(trainIndex)
testDF <- kyphosis %>% slice(-trainIndex)
```

## Recursive Partitioning

TODO: Add exposition

```{r}
library(rpart)
treeModel <- rpart(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start, data = trainDF)
par(xpd = TRUE)
plot(treeModel)
text(treeModel)
```
Left child is yes, right child is no.


```{r}
testDF[1:8,]
```

```{r}
predict(treeModel, testDF[1:8,])
```

## Check Accuracy

TODO: explain

```{r}
predictedKyphosis <- ifelse(predict(treeModel, testDF)[,1] > 0.5, 
                            "absent", "present")
accuracy <- sum(testDF$Kyphosis == predictedKyphosis)/nrow(testDF)
cat("Proportion of correct predictions: ", accuracy, "\n")
```

TODO: Challenge: Try some other random seeds. Does the tree change?

TODO: Problem of overfitting; sensitivity to changes in the dataset.
